We had a good turnout this time, guess planning ahead counts for something. Of course this was in large part due to the great talks we had (e.g. the speaker wasn't Chris or Hui Jing. Not to say they're bad, just that fresh faces are always welcome <span class="o-emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="hugging face">&#x1F917;</span>).
